    <p>Le d&eacute;veloppement du centre d&apos;&eacute;change sur l&apos;acc&egrave;s et le partage des avantages suit son cours depuis l&apos;adoption du Protocole. Prior to the first meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol (ICNP), an expert meeting on the modalities of operation of the ABS Clearing-House was held in April 2011 to examine practical considerations related to the establishment of the ABS Clearing-House with a view to provide input to the first meeting of the ICNP and to assist countries with the early ratification and implementation of the Nagoya Protocol. <br><br>To assist the experts in their deliberations, a study (document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/emabschm-01/official/emabschm-01-02-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ABS/EM-CH/1/2</a>) was commissioned on the issue by the Executive Secretary. Le rapport de la r&eacute;union d&apos;experts (document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/emabschm-01/official/emabschm-01-04-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ABS/EM-CH/1/4</a>) a &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute; &agrave; la premi&egrave;re r&eacute;union du CIPN pour examen. <br><br>At the first meeting of the ICNP, Parties recommended that the first phase of the ABS Clearing-House be a pilot phase and requested the Executive Secretary to implement the pilot phase in accordance with the guidance set out in the annex of recommendation 1/1. <br><br>At its second meeting, the ICNP considered the report on the progress made in the implementation of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House, the suggested mechanisms and applications to be developed during the pilot phase (document <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/icnp-02/official/icnp-02-08-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ICNP/2/8</a>) and the draft modalities of operation of the ABS Clearing-House (document <a href="https://www.cbd.int/doc/meetings/abs/icnp-02/official/icnp-02-09-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/ICNP/2/9</a>). <br><br>In its <a href="https://www.cbd.int/recommendation/icnp/default.shtml?id=13088">recommendation 2/4</a>, the ICNP took note of the suggestions put forward by the Executive Secretary with respect to the development of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House and requested the Executive Secretary to report on further progress made in its implementation at the eleventh Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP-11). En outre, le CIPN a recommand&eacute; que la CdP&nbsp;11 d&eacute;cide d&apos;un processus &agrave; suivre pour faire avancer le d&eacute;veloppement du centre d&apos;&eacute;change sur l&apos;APA. <br><br>The eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties, in <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/COP-11/cop-11-dec-01-en.pdf">decision XI/1</a>, endorsed the indicative work plan and timeline for activities to take place until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol, as contained in document <a href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/COP-11/cop-11-dec-01-en.pdf">UNEP/CBD/COP/11/11</a> and decided to establish an informal advisory committee (IAC) to assist the Executive Secretary with the implementation of the pilot phase and to provide technical guidance with respect to the resolution of technical issues. Le CCI organisera une r&eacute;union, ainsi que des discussions informelles en ligne, et pr&eacute;sentera un rapport &agrave; la troisi&egrave;me r&eacute;union du CIPN. <br><br>The decision also included a request to the Executive Secretary to report on progress made in the implementation of the pilot phase, including on the registration of information related to permits or their equivalents and on technical issues concerning the establishment of the internationally recognized certificate of compliance, and to refine the draft modalities of operation, taking into account the experience acquired during the pilot phase, for their consideration by the third meeting of the ICNP.</p>
