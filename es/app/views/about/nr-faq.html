                        <h3 class="color-grey">What is the format of the Interim National Report?</h3>
                        <p>The form consists of a series of questions mainly focused on those provisions of the Protocol that establish obligations for the Parties to the Protocol. These questions are identified as mandatory and are marked with an asterisk. Each question is structured to select &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; (or in some cases, &ldquo;Not applicable&rdquo;). Generally, these questions are followed by text-boxes where countries are encouraged to provide details on the measures taken as well as to report on difficulties and challenges to implement particular provisions. You can also provide further information on the issue by linking to existing ABS Clearing-House records, websites or uploading documents. Your responses in the text-boxes should be as relevant, succinct and clear as possible.</p>
                        <p>Some questions are not strictly based on the provisions of the Protocol and are identified as voluntary. They will contribute to the assessment and review of the effectiveness of the Protocol in the context of Article 31 and to identify challenges and difficulties in implementing the Protocol.</p>
