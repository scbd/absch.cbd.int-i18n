    <p>Article 14 of the Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization establishes an Access and Benefit-sharing Clearing-House (ABS Clearing-House) as part of the clearing-house mechanism under Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).</p>
    <p>In accordance with recommendation 1/1 of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Intergovernmental Committee for the Nagoya Protocol (the Intergovernmental Committee), the Executive Secretary is currently implementing the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House based on the guidance set out in the annex to recommendation 1/1 and in recommendation 2/4. In addition, the eleventh meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention endorsed an indicative work plan and timeline for activities to take place until the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Protocol (COP-MOP), as contained in document UNEP/CBD/COP/11/11 (decision XI/1 C, paragraph 2).</p>
    <p>In paragraph 1 of decision XI/1 C, the Conference of the Parties established an informal advisory committee (IAC) to assist the Executive Secretary with the implementation of the pilot phase of the ABS Clearing-House and to provide technical guidance with respect to the resolution of technical issues arising from the ongoing development of the pilot phase until the first meeting of the Parties to the Protocol. The decision provided that the IAC should be regionally balanced and composed of fifteen experts selected on the basis of nominations provided by Parties.</p>
    <p>In paragraph 3 of this decision, the Conference of the Parties decided that the IAC would hold one meeting, subject to the availability of financial resources, and informal online discussions, as needed, and report on the outcomes of its work to the third meeting of the Intergovernmental Committee. Thanks to the generous financial support of the European Union, the meeting of the IAC was held in <a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/doc/?meeting=ABS-IAC-CH-01">Montreal, from 2 to 4 October 2013</a>.</p>
