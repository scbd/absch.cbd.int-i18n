    <h1>What does metadata mean?</h1>
    <div>
      <p>The ABS-CH makes use of metadata. This are descriptive information used to identify the ABS-CH record. Some metadata are created automatically when information is submitted to the ABS-CH, such as the owner of the record, the status of the record, the date of submission as well as the category of the common format used.</p>
      <p>In addition to the automatically generated metadata, the person registering the records will also be expected to supply additional metadata to describe the information in the records by selecting descriptive terms from a list of predefined keywords (e.g. the elements describing the content of a legislative measure chosen from a <a translation-url  href="/about/controlled_vocabulary">controlled vocabulary</a>). The collection of this information is meant to facilitate the registration and retrieval of information in the ABS-CH.</p>
