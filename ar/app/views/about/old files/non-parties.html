    <h1> I am not a Party, can I still publish information on the ABS-CH?</h1>
    <div>

      <p><a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-24" target="_new">Article 24</a> of the Protocol provides that Parties shall encourage Non-Parties to adhere to the Protocol and to contribute appropriate information to the ABS-CH. This issue has also been discussed during the ABSCH IAC meeting and there was common understanding that Non-Parties to the Protocol could publish records in the ABS-CH but that a country&rsquo;s status as a Party or Non-Party should be indicated in the record.</p>

     <p>The practice during the pilot phase has been to allow equal participation of Parties to the CBD in the ABS-CH. The difference would be that a Non-Party to the Protocol would not be legally required to comply with the obligations provided by <a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-24" target="_new">Article 14</a>.</p>

    <p>Therefore, currently any record published by a duly designated publishing authority will remain in the ABS-CH until it is deleted by the PA.</p>
