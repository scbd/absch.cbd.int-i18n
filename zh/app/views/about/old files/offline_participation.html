    <h1>I have limited access, how can I participate in the ABS-CH?</h1>
    <div>

      <p>
          It is preferable that the information is registered online through the <a href="/register">register information</a> page.
          However, users with limited Internet access may complete <a href="/about/common-formats">offline common formats</a> and submit them,
          duly signed by the <a href="">publishing authority</a>, to the Secretariat by email or fax (however, common formats
          should only be faxed if sending them by email is impossible).  The Secretariat would then register offline
          submissions of information in the ABS Clearing-House on behalf of Parties.
      </p>

      <p>
          Parties with limited Internet access can request the Secretariat to provide an offline version of the ABS-CH in a portable data storage device (this service is not currenly availbable yet).
      </p>

      <p>
          Please note that these options are available only to users with no Internet access or poor Internet connectivity
