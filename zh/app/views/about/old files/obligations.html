      <p><a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14, paragraph 2</a>, also requires Parties to make available through the ABS Clearing-House any information required by this Protocol.This would include:<ul>
              <li>(a) Measures to inform potential users of traditional knowledge associated with genetic resources about their obligations for access to and fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge (<a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-12" target="_new">Article 12, paragraph 2</a>);</li>
              <li> (b) Information provided to designated checkpoints that collect or receive, as appropriate, relevant information related to prior informed consent, to the source of the genetic resource, to the establishment of mutually agreed terms, and/or to the utilization of genetic resources, including from internationally recognized certificates of compliance, where they are available (<a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-17" target="_new">Article 17, paragraph 1 (a) (iii)</a>); and </li>
              <li>(c) Information on capacity-building and development initiatives at national, regional and international levels that should be shared through the ABS Clearing-House with a view to promoting synergy and coordination on capacity-building and development for access and benefit-sharing (<a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-22" target="_new">Article 22, paragraph 6</a>).&nbsp; </li>
          </ul>
      </p>

      <p>The ABS Clearing-House will also need to provide access to other types of information that Parties may provide relevant to the implementation of the Protocol.Additional information specified in the Protocol (<a translation-url  href="http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/articles/default.shtml?sec=abs-14" target="_new">Article 14, paragraph 3</a>) includes<ul>
